# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical authentication error in the Next.js application where the system crashes with a TypeError when Supabase is not properly configured. The error occurs because the code attempts to call methods on a null Supabase client, causing the entire application to fail during server-side rendering. This fix will implement proper error handling and graceful fallbacks to ensure the application remains functional even when authentication services are unavailable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle missing Supabase configuration gracefully, so that the app doesn't crash during development or when authentication services are temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase environment variables are not configured THEN the system SHALL return null from getSessionUser without throwing errors
2. WHEN getSupabaseServer returns null THEN getSessionUser SHALL immediately return null without attempting to call auth methods
3. WHEN authentication fails due to missing configuration THEN the application SHALL continue to render with demo/fallback user data
4. WHEN the auth service is unavailable THEN server-side rendering SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work in demo mode when authentication is not configured, so that I can still explore the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a demo user with viewer role
2. WHEN in demo mode THEN all UI components SHALL render correctly with fallback data
3. WHEN authentication is restored THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition from demo mode to authenticated mode
4. WHEN using demo mode THEN the user SHALL have limited permissions appropriate for a viewer role

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling patterns in the authentication layer, so that similar issues can be prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication method encounters a null client THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully
2. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately for debugging
3. WHEN implementing new auth features THEN they SHALL follow the established error handling patterns
4. WHEN the system detects missing configuration THEN it SHALL provide helpful development feedback
